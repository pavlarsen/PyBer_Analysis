# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

### My boss, the CEO of the world's leading ride sharing app "PyBer" is looking for insights about the business. Her main goal is to create an efficient method to balance the number of drivers, average fares and amount of rides per city type (urban, suburban and rural). With the power of Python, me and my coworker Omar, used Pandas and Matplotlib to present the ultimate analysis for her to plan. For this analysis, we analyzed weekly ride data from PyBer between January 2019 to April 2019.

Based on the 3 types of cities where PyBer provides service, we can realize that Urban cities generate almost 2 times the total fares from Suburban cities and almost 10 times from Rural cities. There is a positive correlation between the number of total rides and the number of drivers; the more drivers available, the more rides and thus more fare to be generated. In terms of efficiencies, Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver. From the drivers' perspective, rural drivers can almost hit 2 rides from January to May, whereas urban drivers barely complete 1 ride during the same period. This disproportion between the available rural drivers and the urban drivers puts PyBer into a crucial point to take decisions.

## Summary

- PyBer needs to put effort in having more presence in Rural cities by having more drivers available. As implied, rural distances tend to be longer vs urban ones. Before jumping into action, it would be needed to gather data over rural population, how people of these cities get from point A to point B and present a marketing campaign to those residents in order to show the value added PyBer can provide. Will rural PyBer drivers need a different type of vehicle? Perhaps a larger truck would be better for this market.

- For suburban cities, PyBer should present as the main partner for suburban residents who want to party in the city. This will provide longer distance rides which will reflect in higher total fares.

- Regarding urban cities, it is important to notice that there is a higher offer of drivers' available vs rides requested, this tends to lower fare prices for customers. Perhaps capping the total amount of available drivers in urban cities as well as looking for corporate partnerships to transport office workers commute, will help increase the total amount of rides in urban cities as well as total fare.
