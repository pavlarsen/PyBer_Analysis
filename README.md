# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

### My boss, the CEO of the world's leading ride app PyBer is looking for insights about the business. Her main goal is to create an efficient method to balance the amount of drivers, average fares and amount of rides per city type (urban, suburban and rural). With the power of Python, me and my coworker Omar, used Pandas and Matplotlib to present the ultimate analysis for her to make a decision. For this analysis, we analized weekly ride data from January 2019 to April 2019.
